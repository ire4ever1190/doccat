Used on the dimscord server to provide access to the documentation within discord

Will one day get back to this and make it more modular to allow more libraries

To use, create a file called config.json and put this in it

```
{
	"TOKEN": "what the token is",
}
```

don't forget to run `nimble genDb` first
