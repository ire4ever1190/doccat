{"orig":"/home/jake/projects/doc_cat/dimscord/dimscord.nim","nimble":"dimscord","moduleDescription":"Welcome to the Dimscord Documentation!\n<h1><a class=\"toc-backref\" id=\"reference\" href=\"#reference\">Reference</a></h1><ul class=\"simple\"><li>If you have any errors like for example getGuildChannel doesn't exist in v1.0.0, then you can just simply do <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">nimble install dimscord@#head</span></tt> if this does not work then uninstall the version you were using, or you could replace the folder from the <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">.nimble/pkgs</span></tt> directory.</li>\n<li>For objects, this file includes the discord objects, such as Message, Guild, User, Shard, etc.</li>\n<li><p>For gateway, this file allows you to connect, disconnect, send gateway messages to the gateway. Like updating your status with updateStatus, requesting guild members with requestGuildMembers, joining/moving/leaving a voice channel with voiceStateUpdate</p>\n<p>Please note that if you are compiling with ARC or ORC, old objects will be none due to the deepCopy feature being removed, if there are alternatives to this, I'll update, if you do have alternatives, make sure you make a PR to it. You can use on_dispatch for now.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"simple\"><li>For restapi, this file would be pretty self-explantory, as this file would handle ratelimits if you receive lots of 403s or 429s, I'd recommend either stopping your bot or at least check your code like if the bot has the permissions to do this and that, for 429s the lib would at least try to re-send the request, the common ways to get 429s is reactions and you may get 429s, though this is more common in other libraries, if you were to add more reactions, I'd recommend adding some sort of cooldowns to it. (OAuth2 support will be added)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"simple\"><li>For misc, this includes helper methods such as mentioning a user @ify channels, users, roles, etc, this includes iconUrls too.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"simple\"><li>For constants, say if you were to check what verification level is the guild you can use the constants like vlHigh, vlLow, vlVeryHigh, vlMedium, this file includes permission enums like permAddReactions, permViewAuditLogs, permCreateInstantInvite, etc. Intents are also included there. If any of these types are enums and you want to compare them like for example ActivityFlags use <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">cast[int]({myEnum})</span></tt> e.g. <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">cast[int]({afSync})</span></tt></li>\n</ul>\n","entries":[]}
